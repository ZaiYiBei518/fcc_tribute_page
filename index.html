      <strong>March 30th, 1953</strong>Van Gogh is born in Groot-Zundert, the Netherlands. He was the son of Theodorus van Gogh (1822-1885), a preacher, and Anna Cornelia Carbentus (1819-1907).
      <strong>July 1869</strong>Vincent lands a job at Goupil & Cie, an art dealership which has various galleries dotted around Europe. He starts work at its branch in the Hague.
      <strong>October 1888</strong> Paul Guaguin moves into the Yellow House. At first, things go well: the two men get on and paint similar motifs (including, most famously, the Night Cafe). The two men spend 63 days living together.
      <strong>June 1889</strong>Van Gogh paints Starry Night, one of his most famous works, from his room in St Remy.
      <strong>July 27th, 1890</strong>Van Gogh goes to paint wheatfields, but shoots himself in the chest*. He staggers back to his lodgings but dies two days later.

* It is most likely that van Gogh's death was suicide. However, van Gogh scholars Steven Naifeh and Gregory White Smith have proposed a different theory: that he was murdered by two local boys, but that he pretended that he had shot himself so as to keep them out of trouble
